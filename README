No idea what Yaml is, learn Yaml in 5 minutes: http://yaml.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Yaml%20in%205%20minutes

I have tried to keep Yaml 1.2 format http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html

Though there are some things that I have changed and some do not work:

  - Tab character can be used to intend text as well as 2 spaces.
  - Keys and sequence are allowed on same level.
    - Sequence is saved in Object[""]
    - That way we can have digit keys beside integers: "1": "value"
      - One drawback is that JSON does not support it, so when Yaml is dumped to JSON, key/value map becomes a sequence object
  - !!Type is currently not implemented and ignored
